 MINQ minimizes an affine quadratic form subject to simple bounds,
 using coordinate searches and reduced subspace minimizations
    min    fct = gamma + c^T x + 0.5 x^T G x 
    s.t.   x in [xu,xo]    % xu&lt;=xo is assumed
 where G is a symmetric n x n matrix, not necessarily definite
 (if G is indefinite, only a local minimum is found).
 If G is sparse, it is assumed that the ordering is such that
 a sparse modified Cholesky factorization is feasible

 MINQDEF minimizes a definite quadratic form 
 subject to linear constraints
    min    fct = c^T x + 0.5 x^T G x 
    s.t.   A x &gt;= b, with equality at indices with eq=1
 where G is a definite symmetric n x n matrix.
 If A is sparse, it is assumed that the ordering is such that
 sparse Cholesky factorization of G and AG^(-1)A^T are feasible

 MINQSEP minimizes a definite separable quadratic form 
 subject to linear constraints
    min    fct = c^T x + 0.5 x^T D x 
    s.t.   A x &gt;= b, with equality at indices with eq=1
 where D is a definite n x n diagonal matrix.
 If A is sparse, it is assumed that the ordering is such that
 a sparse Cholesky factorization of A^T is feasible

 RLS solves a linear least squares problem
    min    ||Ax-b||_2^2  
    s.t.   |x-x0|&lt;=r
 If r has the default value, RLS can be used to
 regularize least squares problems. In ill-conditioned cases,
 it yields much better approximate solutions than x=A\b,
 though at a time penalty.
